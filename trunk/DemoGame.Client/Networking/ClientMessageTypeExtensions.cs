             * 
             *  - Sequence numbers are unique per NetDeliveryMethod. That is, seqChannel=1 for ReliableOrder is not
             *      the same as seqChannel=1 for UnreliableSequenced.
             *      
             *  - Sequence numbers are not used on Unreliable and ReliableUnordered. For these channels, always use seqChannel=0.
             *  
             *  - The max sequence number is defined by NetConstants.NetChannelsPerDeliveryMethod.
             *      
             *  - All sequences are created equally. They just provide a way to, when using ordering/sequencing, not have to
             *      stall on messages that are irrelevant. For example, say Chat and MapEffect were on the same channel. Then
             *      you send a huge chat message, then a MapEffect message shortly after. For some reason, the chat message gets
             *      lost in the network and has to be retransmitted while the MapEffect arrived very quickly. Even though they are
             *      logically irrelevant, since they use the same channel, the MapEffect will not be handled until that chat message
             *      was received. Putting them on a different sequence channel resolves this issue.
             *      
             *  - Unreliable messages are just raw UDP. Not only can they be lost forever, they can arrive out-of-order and duplicate
             *      copies can arrive.
             *      
             *  - It is perfectly fine, and even recommended, to use the same method and channel for multiple message types. Even if there
             *      is no important distinction on the network layer, it keeps them logically separated in the upper layer. This makes it
             *      very easy to change them on the network layer if needed.
             *      
             *  - Never create or use a message type based on the underlying delivery method and/or sequence channel. How it arrives should
             *      be irrelevant on the upper layer.
             *      
             *  - A delivery method and (when applicable) sequence number should be specified for every message type. Never just rely
             *      on the default behavior.
             *      
             * If you update this comment block, please also update it in the server under:
             *      ServerMessageTypeExtensions.GetDeliveryMethod().
