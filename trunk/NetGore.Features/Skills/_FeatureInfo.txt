Skills are synonymous with spells. They are special actions that characters can use, often at the cost of mana and/or health, and with some
sort of usage delay or cooldown. This feature provides the framework needed for using skills and spells, but does not provide the actual logic
of the skill itself since that is so game specific. Luckily, its easy to define this yourself.
