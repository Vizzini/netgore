GameTime handles the virtual, in-game timing. It works by allowing you to define multiple parameters about how time works in the virtual
world, such as hours in day, days in a month, months in a year, how long day and night lasts, and how fast the game time goes by in
comparison to real-world time. By default, it uses time scales pretty much equal to real-world time, but there is the flexibility to change
it to behave completely different. All of these settings are defined in GameTimeSettings.
