The Shops feature is what allows NPCs to work as vendors, selling items to and optionally buying items from users. Like most games, shops
take a basic approach of being stateless by default. That is, you can buy an infinite number of items from or sell an infinite number of
items to a single shop and the prices or inventory will never change. It is done this way since most people will end up using it in this way,
and it is the easiest to implement.
