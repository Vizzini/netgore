# This file contains the path(s) to use to check for the development
# content. Absolute paths may be used (e.g. C:\netgore\content\), and so
# can relative paths (e.g. ..\..\content\). The suffixed slash is optional.
#
# Relative paths are relative to the application's directory. So if the program
# is located in the path:
# 		C:\NetGore\DemoGame.Client\Build\bin\client.exe
# And you supply the relative path:
# 		..\..\..\content
# Then this will resolve to the path:
# 		C:\NetGore\content
#
# You may supply as many paths as you like. Lines that begin with # or are
# empty will be ignored. The first valid path found is the one that will be used.
# If no valid paths are found, then the application will throw a DirectoryNotFoundException
# only when you try to use ContentPaths.Dev in the code.
